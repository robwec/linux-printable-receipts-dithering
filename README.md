# varco-dither
C++ code to dither images using various algorithms, with scripts to output for 38mm receipt printers or 4"x6" label printers. [Ostromoukhov's](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~ostrom/varcoeffED/) Fourier spectra lookup algorithm seemed to produce the best results in the least time.

To use: place images as .png or .jpg in the same folder as the files. Run one of the .sh shell scripts depending on out size (receipt or 4x6 label) and color preference.
